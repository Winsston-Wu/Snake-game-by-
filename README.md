WELCOME TO THE SNAKE GAME

This is a simple snake game made by me as a business school student（the best that I can do). 

I'm sure you're all more than familiar with this classic game, it will take us back to our childhood and bring back memories of that time.

Rule:
  You will control a constantly moving snake with the goal of eating food that randomly appears on the screen. Each time a food item is eaten, the length of the snake increases by one bar. The difficulty of the game is that as the length of the snake increases, the player needs to maneuver the snake's movement more carefully in order to avoid the snake's head hitting his or her body or the game's boundaries, otherwise the game is over.

Press any key to start the game. Check whether the keyboard input method is in english if the game doesn't respond.

When the game ended, press "R" to restart, and press "Q" to quit the game.
